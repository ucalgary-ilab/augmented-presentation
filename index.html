Aug- mented presentations leverage embedded visuals and animation for visual aids for an engaging and expressive storytelling. How- ever, existing commercial tools like mmhmm or PreziVideo for live presentations lacks interactivity and improvisation, while creat- ing such effects in video editing tools require significant time and expertise. RealityTalk enables users to create live-augmented pre- sentations in real-time and in improvisational ways by interactively prompting, moving, and manipulating graphical elements through real-time speech and supporting modalities. Based on our analysis of 177 existing video-edited augmented presentations, we propose a novel set of interaction techniques and design space based on real-time speech. We then incorporated these techniques into a proof-of-concept authoring and presentation tool of RealityTalk. We evaluate our tool from a presenter’s perspective to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system."><meta property="og:title" content="[UIST 2022] RealityTalk: Real-time Speech-driven Augmented Presentation for AR Live Storytelling"><meta property="og:image" content="https://ilab.ucalgary.ca/augmented-presentation/teaser.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://ilab.ucalgary.ca/augmented-presentation/"><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:description" content="We present RealityTalk, a system that augments real-time live pre- sentations with speech-driven interactive virtual elements.
